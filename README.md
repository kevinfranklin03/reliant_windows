## Introduction
CRM and quoting tool designed to transform how window and home improvement businesses in the UK manage their customer interactions and pricing strategies. Built with scalability, efficiency, and profitability in mind, the platform replaces outdated manual and spreadsheet-based processes with an intelligent, unified solution.

##  Problem

The UK window and home improvement industry faces several challenges due to outdated quoting and customer management practices:

- ❌ Quotes are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone.
- ❌ Pricing relies on guesswork rather than data, impacting profit margins.
- ❌ Customer insights are underused; loyalty and satisfaction are not reflected in offers.
- ❌ Information is scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and handwritten notes.

### End-to-end CRM/ERP Web Application

## Architecture

```

frontend/ (React + Vite)
backend/  (Express + TypeScript)
postgres  (managed or local)
models/   (trained artifacts: .onnx, bucket_stats.json, similarity_index.json, report.html)

````

- Front-end communicates with the Express API (`/api/...` endpoints).
- Express API reads/writes from PostgreSQL.
- ML components enhance pricing suggestions and export artifacts to `models/`.

---

## Folders

- `backend/`
  - `src/db.ts` — PG connection setup.
  - `src/routes.ts` — Main route registry.
  - `src/modules/*` — Business logic for customers, quotes, pricing, etc.
- `frontend/`
  - `src/lib/api/*` — API clients and fetch wrappers.
  - `src/pages/*` — Main pages (Customers, Quotes, etc).
  - `src/components/*` — Reusable UI components.
- `models/` — Exported ML artifacts and reports.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL and create a DB
#    e.g. postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/reliant

# 2. Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Set DATABASE_URL and optional PRICING_* vars
npm install
npm run dev   # or: npm run build && npm start

# 3. Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # Vite dev server (proxies to backend)
````

> ⚠️ This project uses direct SQL with `pg`. Migrations are not included—use your preferred tool (e.g., raw SQL, Prisma, etc.).

---

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```ini
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk....
# Optional (for SSL-enabled DBs)
PGSSL=true

# Optional: ML model paths
PRICING_MODEL_DIR=./models
PRICING_MODEL_PATH=./models/pricing_residual.onnx
PRICING_SIMILAR_PATH=./models/similarity_index.json
PRICING_BUCKET_PATH=./models/bucket_stats.json

# Runtime blend weights: bucket, kNN, onnx
PRICING_BLEND=0.70,0.25,0.05
```

## Pricing Model (ML)

### What it Predicts

A **residual cost uplift (in £)** added to the rule-based subtotal. Adjusts quotes based on historical outcomes.

### Signals Used

* **Categorical**: `service_type`, `timeframe`, `channel`, `postcode_area`, etc.
* **Numeric**: `qty_sum`, `line_count`, `customer_satisfaction`, `customer_total_purchases`.

### Training Process

* **Target**: `total_net − baseline_subtotal` (clipped at ≥ 0).
* **Pipeline**:

  * One-hot encode categoricals
  * Train a linear regression (`RidgeCV`)
* **Artifacts**:

  * `pricing_residual.onnx` – ONNX model
  * `similarity_index.json` – kNN index per bucket
  * `bucket_stats.json` – Shrink-mean priors

### Runtime Blender

Combines 3 signals using weighted average:

1. **Bucket shrink-mean**
2. **kNN neighbors in same bucket**
3. **ONNX model prediction**

Blend ratio set via `PRICING_BLEND` (default: `0.70,0.25,0.05`).

### Metrics & Diagnostics

**OOF Cross-Validation (100 quotes):**

* MAE: **£187.88**
* RMSE: £258.90
* R²: −0.109
* Baseline (global mean MAE): £182.69
* Baseline (bucket mean, non-CV): £21.69 ← *leaky*

**Top Error Buckets (MAE):**

* `supply_and_install|asap|social|B19` — £874.22
* `supply_only|asap|website|B29` — £796.08
* `supply_only|3_6_months|email|B7` — £717.66
* ...

**Generated Plots:**

* `residual_true_vs_pred.png`
* `residual_error_hist.png`

> Generated via: `metrics_report.py`

### Reproduce Training & Report

```bash
# Prepare input data
python train_pricing_model.py \
  --quotes_csv data/quotes.csv \
  --customers_csv data/customers.csv \
  --out_dir models

# Generate diagnostics
python metrics_report.py
# ➜ models/report.html
```

---

## Security & Roles

* Supports custom headers:

## Future
  * `x-api-key` — (optional) API key middleware
  * `x-user-role` — `"admin"`, `"manager"`, or `"staff"` to restrict UI actions
* JWT/session-based auth recommended for production.

---


## Notes for Reviewers

* Codebase is split into **`frontend/`** and **`backend/`**.
* ML layer is **small, interpretable**, and complements rule-based estimates.
* UI is **modular**, clean, and console-style — grouped nav and progressive unlocking (🔒).
